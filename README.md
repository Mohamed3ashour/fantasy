In this application we  develop a similar system to Fantasy PremierFantasy with only a subset of features.
we used agile technique where devided it to several sprints 
In each sprint we focused on some requirements from the requirements backlog 
in each sprint we make Class diagram, Sequence diagram and implement code to match 
Application features and manged it using trello

in sprint 1 :
    1- The user should be able to register to the system. The user should be added by providing 
    some information like name, email, password, and favourite premier league team. 
    After registering user info to the system the user information will be saved into the system so it could be retrieved later.
    2- The user should be able to login to the system. The user should provide credential info like email and password. 
    By logging to the system the user should be able to use all the system functionalities.

    Please refer to fantasy premier league players to get the full attribute list of the player. 
    After the player is added, then the player is eligible to be part of any squad in the system.

    Note: The events should be grouped by game week, so each group week has its own events
